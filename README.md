## How to setup a Jam

A Jam is a TDD-style way of learning. 

To create one, you have to be admin on the Learning Platform.

The format of a Jam is as follow:

-- [Root folder]
    -- [instructions]
        -- exercise-1.md
        -- exercise-2.md
    - exercise-1.pact
    - exercise-1.repl
    - exercise-2.pact
    - exercise-2.repl
    - .hackages

Here are some important points:
- A Jam is a git-based learning solution
- Each exercise is on 1 branch.
- Each branch has 1 or multiple tests associated
- Each branch's name is "exercise-x" where "x" is the exercise number

## Deploy a Jam

To deploy a Jam,  you have to be an ADMIN on the Kadena Learning Platform

Navigate to **manage/jams** and click create a Jam. 

Follow the instructions on that page then save it. 

While testing, you can make it "Private" so It is not visible to everyone. 

You can also mark a Jam as "Internal". It will be visible only to people working at Kadena.
